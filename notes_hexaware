algorithm:

An algorithm is a step-by-step set of instructions
or rules to perform a specific task or solve a 
particular problem.



how to write the algorithm:

algorithm swap(a,b)
{
  temp=a;-1
  a=b;-1
  b=temp;-1
}
f(n)=3
s(n)=3

how to analyze an algorithm:

  1.time 
  2.space
  3.n/w consumption
  4.power consumption
  5.cpu registors

algorithmic paradigms:
```````````````````````

The word paradigm means ' pattern of thought'.

Brute force

divide and conquer

greedy

dynamic programing

note:
these  paradigms define the general structure of 
how the solution would look like.


Brute Forece:

The beauty of a brute force method is that it is pretty 
straightforward and if a solution to a problem exists, 
you are guaranteed to find it. 

This option is also the most exhasustive option as we might 
go through all the possibilities before arriving at the result.


what is brute force method?

Greedy algorithm:

Greedy algorithm is a paradigm that describes the approach on how 
you can go about solving a problem.

making the choice that seems best at that point of time.


datastructure basics:

array
stack
linkedlist
queue


Array:
```````
An array is a linear data structure that is capable of holding values 
that are of a similar type.

arr = 4 8 15 16 23 42

int[] x={4,8,15,16,23,42}

x[0]
x[1]
x[2]
if the array size is n-
maximum index is n-1

int[] physics={}
int[] chemistry={}
int[] biology ={}


  int x[]={20,30,40};
    3
	2
	
x[3]=50;



Linkedlist:
````````````
Linked List is a data structure that is really helpful to write memory 
efficient and fast programs. 

A linked list consists of list nodes. 

Each list node has a value and the address to the next node. 

This chain of nodes is often called as a linked list. 


struct node{


   //this is the data type that we want ti stire
   int data;
   //a pointer to the next node, same type
   struct node*next;

}

list = list -> next

how to traversing a linked list?


stack:

push:
in this operation, we add an element on top 
of the previous element such that the new element 
is now the top element. 
similar to adding a new plate on top of the existing plates.

pop:
this is the deletion operation,

push(): add a new element
pop(): remove an element 

peek()/top(): 

isEmpty():
isFull():


100
  90
  
isFull() -> false


Queue:
A queue is a linear data structure that stores 
data (similar to linkedlists and stacks)
in a queue, the oeder in which the data arrives is important.

A queue is an ordered list in which insertions are doen at one end(rear)
and deletions are done at other end(front)

The first element that you insert, is the first one that is removed. 

Queue: First in First out(FIFO)


Insertion sort:

2,4,6,3,10,k,j


2,3,4,6,10,k,j


2,3,4,6,10,j,k

algorithm:
1.start scanning the elements from 2nd position. 
2.if(arr[i]<arr[i-1])
  1.swap arr[i] and arr[i-1]
  2.keep swapping until the number is less than the previous number.
  
3.The array gets sorted as we reach the end.

 

i=4;
key = 7
j = 4-1=3


[2,5,9,3,7,4,11,13]

2,5,3,9,7,4,11,13

2,3,5,9,7,4,11,13
2,3,5,7,9,4,11,13

/*function to sort array using insertion sort*/

void sort(int arr[])
{

   int n = arr.length; //8
   for(int i=1;i<n;++i){
     int key = arr[i];
	 int j = i-1;
	 
	 while(j>=0 && arr[j] > key){
	    arr[j+1]=arr[j];
		j=j-1;
	 }
   
   arr[j+1] = key;
   }

}

Bubble Sort:
`````````````

Bubble sort is one of the techniques which can be used 
to arrange a set of elements in a certain pre-defined 
manner. 

As the name suggests, at every iteration, the largest 
elements bubbles towards the end.


principle of swapping two elements.

algorithm:

we start from the bottom of the array 
and look for smaller elements.

select the last element

if the second last element is greater than the selected number, 
swap both of them.

Now compare the second last number with the third last number.
if the number is not small, then do not swap, else again swap.

This way by swapping each time, we will get the smallest 
number in the array and it will bubble at the top of the array

[5,6,9,4,8,2]

void bubbleSort(int arr[])
{
  int n =  arr.length;
  for(int i=0;i<n-1;i++)
  {
    for(int j=0;j<n-i-1;j++){
	  if(arr[j]> arr[j+1]){
	  //swap arr[j+1] and arr[j]
	  int temp= arr[j];
	  arr[j]=arr[j+1];
	  arr[j+1]=temp;
	  }
 }
 
merge sort
selection sort


linear search:

[13,0,8,15,1,6,2,7,21,3,4,9,5]

Number to search = 7,25


1.start from the first element.
2.check if it matches the target element.
3.if yes, we found the element
4.else, move ahead and check again
5.Repeat the above process till you reach the end of the array.

public static boolean linearSearch(int[] arr,int numberToSearch){

    boolean found = false;
	
	//search sequentially through each element
	
	for(int i=0;i<arr.length;i++){
	
	    if(arr[i] == numberToSearch){
		   found=true;
		   break;
		}
	   
	}
	
	return found;
	}
	
sorted linear search:
`````````````````````
[0,1,2,3,4,5,7,8,13,15,21,30,99]

6


public static boolean linearSearch(int[] arr,int numberToSearch){

    boolean found = false;
	
	//search sequentially through each element
	
	for(int i=0;i<arr.length;i++){
	
	    if(arr[i] == numberToSearch){
		   found=true;
		  
		   if(arr[i] > numberToSearch)
		   break;
		}
	   
	}
	
	return found;
	}
	


Binary Search:
It is one of the most important search algorithm in computer programming.

As the name suggests, binary means 2, it involes bisecting the array in 2 halves
 at every step to ultimately narrow down our search space.
 
 The only restriction is that the list should be sorted.
 


working of binary search:


numberToSearch = 12

  [1,3,4,6,7,9,10,12,13,15,16,19,20,23,24,27,2,31]
  

algorithm:

1.set the start position as begininig of array.

2.set the end position as the end of array.

3.start a loop

4.check the middle eleement. if it matches , we found our result.

5.if (middle element > number to search), update the end position to middle

6.else , update the first position 

7.Repeat steps 4-6 until we find our element, or exhaust out of options.


static boolean binarySearch(int[] arr, int numberToSearch)
{

 int left = 0;
 int right = arr.length-1;
 
 while(left < = right){
 
   //find the mid index
   int mid = (left + right) / 2
 
   //check at mid index
   if(arr[mid]==numberToSearch)
   return true;
   //update the terminal indices
   
   if(arr[mid] <numberToSearch){
      left = mid + 1;
   
   }
   else
   right= mid-1;
 
 }

  return false;

}


some factors are considered for choosing the datastructure:

what type of data needs to be stored?
cost of operations
memory usage


A tree is also one of the data structure that represent hierarchal data. 



public static void main(String[] args)
{

TreeNode root = new TreeNode(4);
root.left = new TreeNode(8);
root.right = new TreeNOde(15);

TreeNode leftNode = root.left;
TreeNode rightNode = root.right;

leftNode.left = new TreeNode(16);

rightNode.left=new TreeNode(23);
rightNOde.right = new TreeNode(42);


System.out.println(root.val);
System.out.println(root.right.left.val);

Software Development Life Cycle

It is a systematic process for planning , creating, testing, deploying 
and maintaining software.

it consists of various phases, each serving a specific purpose in the 
development process. 

1.Requirements Gathering and Analysis

2.Planning

3.Design

4.implementation (coding)

5.Testing

6.Deployment

7.Maintainence and Support


Each phase is interconnected and the SDLC provides a structured approach
to software development, helping teams manage and control 
te entire process effectively.


1.waterfall model
2.Iterative model
3.Incremental model
4.V-Model(Verification and Validation Model)
5.Spiral Model
6.Agile Model

   Agile is an iterative and incremental model that 
   emphasizes flexibility and customer feedback.
   sprint
   dev -> qa -> devops team -> db team ->

scrum



agile model / agile methodology/ agile process:


It is an iterative and incremental approach/process.


Agile principles:

1) Customer no need to wait for long time.
2) We develop,test and release piece of software to the customer with few no.of 
   features.
3) we can accept/accomodate requirement changes.

There will be good communication between  Customer,Business Analyst,Developer 
and Tester.

Advantages:

Requirement changes are allowed in any stage of development or we can accomodate
requirement changes in the middel of the development.

Releases will be very fast(weekly)

Customer no need to wait for long time .

Good communcation betweeen team.

It is very easy model to adopt.


Disadvantge:
less focus on design and documentation since we diliver software very faster.


scrum:
``````
scrum is a framework through whihc we build software product by following 
Agile principles.

Scrum includes group of people called as scrum team.

Normally contains 5 to 9 members.


1)Product Owner

2)Scrum Master

3)Dev Team 

4)QA team


Product owner:
``````````````
Define the features of the product.

Prioritize features according to market value.

Adjust features and priority every iteration, as needed

Accept or reject work results.


Scrum Master:
The main role is facilitating and driving the agile process.

and servant-leader responsible for ensuring the scrum team 
adheres to agile principples and follows the scrum framework.
 
 They help remove obstacles, faster collaboration and 
 enable continuious improvement within the team .
 
 
Developers and QA:

  Develop and Test the software

product backlog:
contains list of user stories. prepared by product owner.

sprint/iteration:
period of time to complete the user stories, decided by the product owner 
and team, usually 2-4 weeks of time.

sprint planning meeting:
Metting conducts with the team to define what can be delivered in the sprint
and duration.

sprint backlog:
List of commited stories by Dev/QA for specific sprint.

Scrum meeting:
meeting conducted by scrum master everyday 15 mnts. called as 
scrum call /standup meeting.

-what did you do yesterday?
-what will you do today?
-Are there any impediments in your way?


sprint retrospective meeting:


conducts meeting after completion of sprint.
The entire team including both the Scrummaster and the product owner 
should participate.


story point:

Rough estimation of user stories, will be given by Dev & QA 
in the form of fibonacci series.

0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13... 

login - dev - 5 qa -3(8hrs)


Burndown chart:
shows how much work remaining in the sprint.
Maintained by the scrum master daily.

A relation/table will be in 1nf if it contains an atomic values.

it states that an attribute of a table cannot hold multiple values.
It must hold only single valued attribute.

First normal form disallow the multi valued attributes.

Relation student is not in 1nf because of multivalued attribute languages known.

joins:

innerjoin:
innerjoin returns intersection of rows that satisfy join condition.

if a row in the first table has no matching row in the second table, 
or viceversa, that row will excluded from the resultset.

syntax:

 select col1,col2... from table1 inner join table2 on table1.colname=
 table2.colname;


requirement:

names of the employees along with their department names?

inner join on department_id column (since it is a common column)


select emp.empno,emp.ename,dept.dname from emp inner join dept on 
emp.deptno=dept.deptno;


LEFT JOIN:
LEFT OUTER JOIN
purpose: retrieve all records from left side table
(the table specified before the 'LEFT JOIN' keyword and the matched 
records from the right table.
If there is no match, NULL values are returned for columns 
from the right table.

syntax:
SELECT col1,col2... FROM table1 LEFT JOIN table2 
ON table1.col=table2.col;

example:
select emp.empno,emp.ename,dept.dname from dept left join emp on emp.deptno=dept.deptno;

select emp.empno,emp.ename,dept.dname from emp left join dept on emp.deptno=dept.deptno;

full join:

select emp.empno,emp.ename,dept.dname from emp left join dept on emp.deptno=dept.deptno union
select emp.empno,emp.ename,dept.dname from emp right join dept on emp.deptno=dept.deptno where emp.empno is null

self join:

Subquery:
A subquery in sql is a query nested within another query.

It can be used in various parts of a sql statement, such as 
select from, where, or having clauses. 

subqueries are enclosed in parentheses and can return a single value, 
a single row, a single column or a result set with multiple rows 
and columns.

select col1,col2 from tab1 where 
col3=(select col4 from tab2 where condition);



select col1,col2 from tab1 where 
col3 in(select col4 from tab2 where condition);

coorelated subquery:
select col1,col2 from tab1 t1 where col3>(select avg(col3) from tab1 t2 
where t2.category=t1.category);


1.Retrieve employees who work in the 'IT department'.


select ename from emp where deptno=
(select deptno from dept where dname='RESEARCH');


2.Retrieve employee who work in the RESEARCH or SALES department?

 select ename from emp where deptno in (select deptno from dept where dname in('RESEARCH','SALES')); 

3.Find employees whose salary is above the the average salary
  in their respective departments?
  
  select ename from emp e where sal > 
  (select avg(sal) from emp where deptno=e.deptno));

4.Retrieve department names along with the total no.of employees in each 
  department?
  
  select dname,(select count(*) from emp where deptno=dept.deptno)as num_employees from dept;





select ename from emp where deptno=(select deptno from dept where dname='RESEARCH');
select ename from emp where deptno in (select deptno from dept where dname in('RESEARCH','SALES')); 
select ename from emp e where sal > (select avg(sal) from emp where deptno=e.deptno);
select dname,(select count(*) from emp where deptno=dept.deptno)as num_employees from dept;

class is a collection of variables and methods 

how to declare the variables using datatypes .

method:
`````````
method is the place where we are writing the logic. 


[accessmodifier] <returntype> <methodname>([if any parameters])
{

   //logic 
}

void : it is a return type means what it doesn't return any value. 

void sum()
{
System.out.println("sum");
}

void sum(int x, int y)
{
System.out.println(x+y);
}

int getAge()
{
  return 36; 
}
note:return type and return value must be compatible with each other.

int getSum(int x, int y)
{
  return x+y;
}

finally we are keeping these variables and methods inside a class. 
class is a collection of 
   -variables 
   & methods 
   
   
shall we define one class name as Student contains some properties like 
stid,stname,staddress and print their details?


class Student{

 //variables initialization  
  int stid = 100;
  String stname= "anushka";
  String staddress = "bnglr";
  
 //display these details 
 
  public void displayStudentDetails()
  {
     System.out.println("student id is:" + stid);
	 System.out.println("student name is:" + stname);
	 System.out.println("Student address is: " + staddress);
  }


}
-------------------------------------------------

class Student {

	// variables initialization
	int stid = 100;
	String stname = "anushka";
	String staddress = "bnglr";

	// display these details

	public void displayStudentDetails() {

from instance area, if we want to access instance properties how can 
we access?
directly we can access


from any area means either instance area or static area if we want 
to access static properties how can we access?

  using class name or directly or object name
  
from static area if we want to access instance varaibles how can we 
access?

 using object name 
 
 

public class Test2 {
	
	int x = 100;//instance variable
	static int y = 20;//class level variable or static variable
	
	void display()

without constructor :


public class Test4 {
	
	int x;
	String y;
	
	
	
	public void setValues()
	{
		//initialization logic 
		x=100;
		y="Rama";
	}
	
	public void display()
	{
		System.out.println("student id is: " + x);
		System.out.println("student name is : " + y);
	}
	
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		//static area
		//create the object for class 
		Test4 obj= new Test4();
		
		//calling setValues
		obj.setValues();
		//calling display()
		obj.display();
		
	}
	

}

example:
````````

public class Test4 {
	
	int x;
	String y;
	//constructor 
	public Test4()
	{
		//initialization logic
		x=100;
		y="rk";
	}
	
	
	
	public void display()

	}
	
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		//static area
		//create the object for class 
		Test4 obj= new Test4();
		
		
		//calling display()
		obj.display();
		
	}
	

}


types of constructor:

  1.default constructor -constructor which doesn't takes any parameters
  2.parameterized constructor -constructor which takes parameters 
  
  
  
  
 if you are note defining any constructor(s) in a class, java compiler 
will generate one default constructor automatically  known as 
system defined default constructor .

purpose: it will assign the default values 
for every datatype there is a default value
for the integer category -> 0
for the float category - 0.0
for the character category - single space
for the boolean category - false 

  
example on parameterized constructor;
````````````````````````````````````

public class Test4 {
	//class level variables 
	int x;
	String y;
	
	//parameterized constructor 
    public Test4(int x, String y) {
    	
    	this.x=x;
    	this.y=y;
    }
   
	public void display()
	{
		System.out.println("student id is: " + x);
		System.out.println("student name is : " + y);
	}
	
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		//static area
		//create the object for class 
		Test4 obj= new Test4(100,"rk");
		
		
		//calling display()
		obj.display();
		
	}
	

}

can't we define both in a single class?

yes 

try to define both default and parameterized constructor ?


this:
this is the java reserved keyword and we are using in follwing two cases

1.constructor chaining(refer this) and do one program 
2.to differentiate class level varaibles and method level parameters when 
both are same .

we have 4 oops principles 

 inheritance 
 polymorphism 
 abstraction 
 encapsulation 
 

if you really want to compare any objects reference based we should use 
== operator



inheritance:
 
   inheritance is the process of taking the properties from one class 
   to another class. 
   
   usage: reusability 
   
   using extends keyword we can practically implement inheritance. 
   
note:
when we apply the inheritance concept we should create the object 
for child class only not parent class (not recommended)

 
encapsulation:
`````````````
encapsulation is the process of wrapping up of variables and methods 

data hiding 
security 

because to make a class as an encapsulated class, we have to follow 
some rules

   every variable should be declared as private 
   but for every variable we should maintain public setter and getter methods
   
   setter method -> to set the values into an object
   getter method -> to get the values from an object 
   
   
Employee.java:
``````````````
//encapsulated class
public class Employee {
	//private variables
	private int empid;
	private String empname;
	
	//defining public setters and getter methods
	public int getEmpid() {
		return empid;
	}
	public void setEmpid(int empid) {
		this.empid = empid;
	}
	public String getEmpname() {
		return empname;
	}
	public void setEmpname(String empname) {
		this.empname = empname;
	}
	
	
}

Test6.java:
```````````
//execution logic class
public class Test6 {
	
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		
		Employee emp = new Employee();
		
		emp.setEmpid(100);
		emp.setEmpname("rk");
		
		System.out.println("employee id is: " + emp.getEmpid());
		System.out.println("employee name is:" + emp.getEmpname());
	}

}

polymorphism:
`````````````````

method overloading:


public class Test7 {
	public void sum(int a, int b)
	{
		System.out.println(a+b);
	}

	public void sum(double a, double b)
	{
		System.out.println(a+b);
	}
	
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		
		Test7 obj = new Test7();
		obj.sum(5, 6);
		obj.sum(6.7,8.9);
			
	}
}

method overriding:
````````````````````
Parent.java:
```````````

public class Parent {

	//overridden method
	public void sum(int x, int y)
	{
		System.out.println("sum is: " +(x+y));
	}
}

Child.java:
``````````

public class Child extends Parent {

	//overriding method
	public void sum(int x, int y) {
		
		System.out.println("sub is: " +(x-y));
	}
	
}

Test8.java:
````````````

public  class Test8 {
	
	public static void main(String[] args) {
		
		/*Child obj = new Child();
		obj.sum(6, 5);*/
		
		/*Parent obj = new Parent();
		obj.sum(6, 5);*/
		//upcasting
		Parent obj = new Child();
		obj.sum(6, 5);
		
		
		
		
	}

}
