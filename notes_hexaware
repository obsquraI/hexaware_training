algorithm:

An algorithm is a step-by-step set of instructions
or rules to perform a specific task or solve a 
particular problem.



how to write the algorithm:

algorithm swap(a,b)
{
  temp=a;-1
  a=b;-1
  b=temp;-1
}
f(n)=3
s(n)=3

how to analyze an algorithm:

  1.time 
  2.space
  3.n/w consumption
  4.power consumption
  5.cpu registors

   s=0;                      1
   for(i=0;i<n;i++)          
   {
     s=s+A[i];

algorithmic paradigms:
```````````````````````

The word paradigm means ' pattern of thought'.

Brute force

divide and conquer

greedy

dynamic programing

note:
these  paradigms define the general structure of 
how the solution would look like.


Brute Forece:

The beauty of a brute force method is that it is pretty 
straightforward and if a solution to a problem exists, 
you are guaranteed to find it. 

This option is also the most exhasustive option as we might 
go through all the possibilities before arriving at the result.


what is brute force method?

Greedy algorithm:

Greedy algorithm is a paradigm that describes the approach on how 
you can go about solving a problem.

making the choice that seems best at that point of time.


datastructure basics:

array
stack
linkedlist
queue


Array:
```````
An array is a linear data structure that is capable of holding values 
that are of a similar type.

arr = 4 8 15 16 23 42

int[] x={4,8,15,16,23,42}

x[0]
x[1]
x[2]
if the array size is n-
maximum index is n-1

int[] physics={}
int[] chemistry={}
int[] biology ={}


  int x[]={20,30,40};
    3
	2
	
x[3]=50;



Linkedlist:
````````````
Linked List is a data structure that is really helpful to write memory 
efficient and fast programs. 

A linked list consists of list nodes. 

Each list node has a value and the address to the next node. 

This chain of nodes is often called as a linked list. 


struct node{


   //this is the data type that we want ti stire
   int data;
   //a pointer to the next node, same type
   struct node*next;

}

list = list -> next

how to traversing a linked list?


stack:

push:
in this operation, we add an element on top 
of the previous element such that the new element 
is now the top element. 
similar to adding a new plate on top of the existing plates.

pop:
this is the deletion operation,

push(): add a new element
pop(): remove an element 

peek()/top(): 

isEmpty():
isFull():


100
  90
  
isFull() -> false


Queue:
A queue is a linear data structure that stores 
data (similar to linkedlists and stacks)
in a queue, the oeder in which the data arrives is important.

A queue is an ordered list in which insertions are doen at one end(rear)
and deletions are done at other end(front)

The first element that you insert, is the first one that is removed. 

Queue: First in First out(FIFO)


Insertion sort:

2,4,6,3,10,k,j


2,3,4,6,10,k,j


2,3,4,6,10,j,k

algorithm:
1.start scanning the elements from 2nd position. 
2.if(arr[i]<arr[i-1])
  1.swap arr[i] and arr[i-1]
  2.keep swapping until the number is less than the previous number.
  
3.The array gets sorted as we reach the end.

 

i=4;
key = 7
j = 4-1=3


[2,5,9,3,7,4,11,13]

2,5,3,9,7,4,11,13

2,3,5,9,7,4,11,13
2,3,5,7,9,4,11,13

/*function to sort array using insertion sort*/

void sort(int arr[])
{

   int n = arr.length; //8
   for(int i=1;i<n;++i){
     int key = arr[i];
	 int j = i-1;
	 
	 while(j>=0 && arr[j] > key){
	    arr[j+1]=arr[j];
		j=j-1;
	 }
   
   arr[j+1] = key;
   }

}

Bubble Sort:
`````````````

Bubble sort is one of the techniques which can be used 
to arrange a set of elements in a certain pre-defined 
manner. 

As the name suggests, at every iteration, the largest 
elements bubbles towards the end.


principle of swapping two elements.

algorithm:

we start from the bottom of the array 
and look for smaller elements.

select the last element

if the second last element is greater than the selected number, 
swap both of them.

Now compare the second last number with the third last number.
if the number is not small, then do not swap, else again swap.

This way by swapping each time, we will get the smallest 
number in the array and it will bubble at the top of the array

[5,6,9,4,8,2]

void bubbleSort(int arr[])
{
  int n =  arr.length;
  for(int i=0;i<n-1;i++)
  {
    for(int j=0;j<n-i-1;j++){
	  if(arr[j]> arr[j+1]){
	  //swap arr[j+1] and arr[j]
	  int temp= arr[j];
	  arr[j]=arr[j+1];
	  arr[j+1]=temp;
	  }
 }
 
merge sort
selection sort


linear search:

[13,0,8,15,1,6,2,7,21,3,4,9,5]

Number to search = 7,25


1.start from the first element.
2.check if it matches the target element.
3.if yes, we found the element
4.else, move ahead and check again
5.Repeat the above process till you reach the end of the array.

public static boolean linearSearch(int[] arr,int numberToSearch){

    boolean found = false;
	
	//search sequentially through each element
	
	for(int i=0;i<arr.length;i++){
	
	    if(arr[i] == numberToSearch){
		   found=true;
		   break;
		}
	   
	}
	
	return found;
	}
	
sorted linear search:
`````````````````````
[0,1,2,3,4,5,7,8,13,15,21,30,99]

6


public static boolean linearSearch(int[] arr,int numberToSearch){

    boolean found = false;
	
	//search sequentially through each element
	
	for(int i=0;i<arr.length;i++){
	
	    if(arr[i] == numberToSearch){
		   found=true;
		  
		   if(arr[i] > numberToSearch)
		   break;
		}
	   
	}
	
	return found;
	}
	


Binary Search:
It is one of the most important search algorithm in computer programming.

As the name suggests, binary means 2, it involes bisecting the array in 2 halves
 at every step to ultimately narrow down our search space.
 
 The only restriction is that the list should be sorted.
 


working of binary search:


numberToSearch = 12

  [1,3,4,6,7,9,10,12,13,15,16,19,20,23,24,27,2,31]
  

algorithm:

1.set the start position as begininig of array.

2.set the end position as the end of array.

3.start a loop

4.check the middle eleement. if it matches , we found our result.

5.if (middle element > number to search), update the end position to middle

6.else , update the first position 

7.Repeat steps 4-6 until we find our element, or exhaust out of options.


static boolean binarySearch(int[] arr, int numberToSearch)
{

 int left = 0;
 int right = arr.length-1;
 
 while(left < = right){
 
   //find the mid index
   int mid = (left + right) / 2
 
   //check at mid index
   if(arr[mid]==numberToSearch)
   return true;
   //update the terminal indices
   
   if(arr[mid] <numberToSearch){
      left = mid + 1;
   
   }
   else
   right= mid-1;
 
 }

  return false;

}


some factors are considered for choosing the datastructure:

what type of data needs to be stored?
cost of operations
memory usage


A tree is also one of the data structure that represent hierarchal data. 



public static void main(String[] args)
{

TreeNode root = new TreeNode(4);
root.left = new TreeNode(8);
root.right = new TreeNOde(15);

TreeNode leftNode = root.left;
TreeNode rightNode = root.right;

leftNode.left = new TreeNode(16);

rightNode.left=new TreeNode(23);
rightNOde.right = new TreeNode(42);


System.out.println(root.val);
System.out.println(root.right.left.val);
}

Software Development Life Cycle

It is a systematic process for planning , creating, testing, deploying 
and maintaining software.

it consists of various phases, each serving a specific purpose in the 
development process. 

1.Requirements Gathering and Analysis

2.Planning

3.Design

4.implementation (coding)

5.Testing

6.Deployment

7.Maintainence and Support


Each phase is interconnected and the SDLC provides a structured approach
to software development, helping teams manage and control 
te entire process effectively.


1.waterfall model
2.Iterative model
3.Incremental model
4.V-Model(Verification and Validation Model)
5.Spiral Model
6.Agile Model

   Agile is an iterative and incremental model that 
   emphasizes flexibility and customer feedback.
   sprint
   dev -> qa -> devops team -> db team ->

scrum



agile model / agile methodology/ agile process:


It is an iterative and incremental approach/process.


Agile principles:

1) Customer no need to wait for long time.
2) We develop,test and release piece of software to the customer with few no.of 
   features.
3) we can accept/accomodate requirement changes.

There will be good communication between  Customer,Business Analyst,Developer 
and Tester.

Advantages:

Requirement changes are allowed in any stage of development or we can accomodate
requirement changes in the middel of the development.

Releases will be very fast(weekly)

Customer no need to wait for long time .

Good communcation betweeen team.

It is very easy model to adopt.


Disadvantge:
less focus on design and documentation since we diliver software very faster.


scrum:
``````
scrum is a framework through whihc we build software product by following 
Agile principles.

Scrum includes group of people called as scrum team.

Normally contains 5 to 9 members.


1)Product Owner

2)Scrum Master

3)Dev Team 

4)QA team


Product owner:
``````````````
Define the features of the product.

Prioritize features according to market value.

Adjust features and priority every iteration, as needed

Accept or reject work results.


Scrum Master:
The main role is facilitating and driving the agile process.

and servant-leader responsible for ensuring the scrum team 
adheres to agile principples and follows the scrum framework.
 
 They help remove obstacles, faster collaboration and 
 enable continuious improvement within the team .
 
 
Developers and QA:

  Develop and Test the software

Metting conducts with the team to define what can be delivered in the sprint
and duration.

sprint backlog:
List of commited stories by Dev/QA for specific sprint.

Scrum meeting:
meeting conducted by scrum master everyday 15 mnts. called as 
scrum call /standup meeting.

-what did you do yesterday?
-what will you do today?
-Are there any impediments in your way?


sprint retrospective meeting:


conducts meeting after completion of sprint.
The entire team including both the Scrummaster and the product owner 
should participate.


story point:

Rough estimation of user stories, will be given by Dev & QA 
in the form of fibonacci series.

0 1 1 2 3 5 8 13...

Normalization:
A relation will be in 1nf if it contains an atomic values.

it states that an attribute of a table cannot hold multiple values.
It must hold only single valued attribute.

First normal form disallow the multi valued attributes.

Relation student is not in 1nf because of multivalued attribute languages known.

Second Normal Form(2nf):
A relation will be in 2NF if it is is 1NF and not contain any partial dependency
i.e No partial dependency.

Third Normal Form(3NF):
A table will be in 3NF. if it is in 2nf and if there is no transitive 
dependency for non-prime attributes then the table is in third normal form.

Boyce-codd normal form(BCNF):
Boyce-codd normal form(BCNF) is an extension to the third normal form. 
It is also known as 3.5NF.

BCNF is the advanced version of 3NF. it is stricter than 3NF.

rules:
A table is in BCNF,
1.If it is in 3NF
2.And, for any dependency A->B
  A should be a super key
